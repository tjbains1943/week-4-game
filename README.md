# week-4-game
In this game the user has to match the random number generated to win the game. The user does this by clicking on one of the four crystals, each of which has a randomly generated number value itself. Once the user figures out the value of each crystal in that round, they can figure out how many of each crystal needs to be clicked or added to reach the goal number.
